# Rhyme Schemes for Rap

In rap, a rhyme scheme determines and explains which lines of the rap rhyme with other lines in the rap. Rhyme schemes are notated in letters like ABAB. These letters represent four lines of the rap; the lines with the same letters rhyme.

## How do you identify a rhyme scheme?

To identify a rhyme scheme, start with Line 1. Label it with an A. Subsequent lines that rhyme with Line 1 are also labeled with A. Each time the end rhyme of a line changes, it gets a new letter.

## What is an ABAB rhyme scheme example?

Example of an ABAB rhyme scheme:

A: My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;  
B: Coral is far more red than her lips' red;  
A: If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;  
B: If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.

The first and third lines rhyme, and the second and fourth lines rhyme: ABAB.
