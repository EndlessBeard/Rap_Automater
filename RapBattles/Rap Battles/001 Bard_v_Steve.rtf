Ya "tiger stripes" and "lion" talk? Just circus acts for tourists\uc0\u8232 While I'm servin' verbal poison like the Bard's most potent purist\u8232 Thy wit is blunter than a dagger made of melted butter\u8232 I'll leave ya stammerin' like Hamlet's ghost\'97can't even mutter\
Omaha's finest? More like Nebraska's biggest mistake\uc0\u8232 I'll bury ya beneath oil sands, toss ya in a frozen lake\u8232 My dusty boom-bap rhythm's perfect for ya funeral march\u8232 As I stand over ya grave with victory arch\
Thy rhymes be lighter than the feather of a newborn fowl\uc0\u8232 While mine crush like avalanche, makin' enemies howl\u8232 A butch bard from the north, I'm the true alpha in this zoo\u8232 Exit stage left\'97thy final act is overdue, fool\

Washed away, Shakespearean decay.\u8232 Animalistic precision, my wit incision, lyrical zoologist dissectin' thy diction with friction,\u8232 Omaha-born, storms form when I perform\'97your rhymes lukewarm, mine swarm and strike in perfect form.\
Alberta winds blow cold, but Nebraska breeds tornados,\uc0\u8232 You're spinnin' soliloquies, I drop truth grenades, though\'97\u8232 Zookeeper legend, Shakespearean endin\'92, bars bendin\'92, transcending pretendin\'92,\u8232 Final act curtain call\'97thy Bard's career endin\'92.\

Thy tornado warnings fall flat like bad theater reviews While I drill deeper than Alberta's richest crude These coveralls hide scars from literary abuse I've dealt to weaklings who thought their flow was improved\
Zookeeper? More a petting farm attendant at most My quill drips venom that Shakespeare himself would boast From northern plains I rise like a vengeful ghost While thy Midwest metaphors burn up like paper toast\
Thou speak'st of animals but can't handle this beast Wife-beater showing muscles forged in northern cold Thy "apex predator" act is finished, deceased My butch bars break spirits, leaving legends untold\
If "zookeeper legend" is the crown thou claims Then I'm the poacher who mounts thy head in frames Omaha's finest falls to Edmonton flames Exit thy stage now\'97remember the Bard's name!\
