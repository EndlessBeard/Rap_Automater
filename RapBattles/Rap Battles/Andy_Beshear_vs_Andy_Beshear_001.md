### Rapper A - Verse 1

```markdown
### Rap Battle - Turn 1

*(Music Section 1 - Intro starts: Solo banjo riff, then fiddle joins)*

A [Confident] Yo, beat drops in, strings start to play
A [Confident] Got the rhythm locked in, come what may
B [Observant] See the crowd watching, eyes on the stage
B [Assertive] 'Bout to turn the page, write a new age

A [Slightly mocking] Heard 'bout the hero, from the holler's heart
A [Slightly mocking] Playing the part, right from the start
B [Gritty] But the concrete jungle got a different sound
B [Gritty] Where the hustle is real, all around

A [Challenging] You talkin' 'bout floods and fixing the levee
A [Challenging] My burdens are heavy, steady, ready
B [Direct] This ain't the statehouse, ain't no press brief
B [Direct] Just raw relief, beyond belief

A [Energized] The banjo is singin', the fiddle is high
A [Energized] Watch the real MC fly, touch the sky
B [Warning] Bluegrass B, you stepped in the wrong ring
B [Warning] Hear the city king, make the mic swing
```

### Rapper B - Verse 1

```markdown
### Rap Battle - Turn 2

*(Music Section 2 - Verse 1 starts: full rhythm section, banjo lead)*

A [Right on tempo] Alright, the banjo's pickin', feel the drum hit hard
A [Played your card] Heard your intro, played your card
B [Different kinda grind] Talkin' kings and concrete, that's your stage
B [Turning the page] But the spirit from the soil turns the page

A [Understand the strain] You mention the concrete, yeah I get that life
A [Seen the real pain] But I've seen folks lose it all to storm and strife
B [Built different] Rebuilding takes grit, somethin' you can't fake
B [Rising up] A spirit that rises for goodness sake

A [Keeping folks safe] You laughed 'bout the levees, the work of my hand
A [Across the land] That's saving the homes all across the land
B [Wisdom comes slow] See, leading ain't flash, it's common sense flow
B [For the people] Putting people first, lettin' that feeling grow

A [Just the real me] So I ain't the 'city king' with a flashy parade
A [For the people] Just a voice for the people, unafraid
B [Signature phrase] We face downs together, like "We get through it"
B [Signature phrase] From hollers to headlines, yeah we do it
