AA * BB * \
Magician Luigi, tricks cheap like fake gold * I'm Teflon Don, stories forever told *\
Your wand's plastic, my suit tailored supreme * You're disappearing, I'm living the dream *\
AA * BB * \
Chains heavy, crown tilted, MAGA cap divine * Your spells failing, but my power refined * \
Your flow vanishes, puff of smoke weak * I'm stacking mansions, every day of the week *\
AA * BB * \
They chant my slogans, "believe me," unmatched * Your act old news, recycled and patched * \
Critics fuel my fire, victimhood power * Your tricks expire, forgotten in an hour *\
AA * BB * \
Binary rhymes, winners and losers known * Luigi, you're weak, step down from my throne * \
My brand timeless, tremendous and strong * Your magic's fleeting, Teflon reigns long *\

ABBA * ABBA * \
Your gold-plated claims don't impress Il Mago * While you're shouting noise, I orchestrate the show * \
Your smoke and mirrors can't conceal what I know * Your empire's built on sand, about to undergo *\
ABBA * ABBA * \
A calculated fall\'97watch the dominoes align * I don't need your throne, I walk between the lines \
* Your brand's a bubble, fragile as cheap wine * My legacy's encrypted in each measured rhyme *\
ABBA * ABBA * \
You talk of mansions while I own mental estates * Your recycled phrases reveal your mental state \
* My words are surgical\'97no need to compensate * I whisper truths that make empires disintegrate *\
ABBA * ABBA * \
The real magic isn't tricks, it's precision and time * Your Teflon coating's wearing thin, past its prime \
* The quiet power speaks volumes when I climb * The mic\'97checkmate, Don\'97this victory's mine *\
\ul Don Verse 2\ulnone \
AB * BA * \
Your rhymes stale, Luigi, I'm the prime-time choice * Your whispers drowned out by my thunderous voice * \
My gold\'92s real heavy, your shine just pretend * Teflon Don stands strong, your illusions end *\
AB * BA * \
Dominoes fall? Nah, my empire stays stacked * You're between lines, while I make real impact * \
My brand unbreakable, your verses confined * Encrypted rhymes crumble, but my legacy defined *\
AB * BA * \
Mental estates? Mine stretch across the land * Your "truth" mere smoke, castles built on sand * \
Your surgical words dull, lose their effect * My recycled power, an empire erect *\
AB * BA * \
My Teflon armor eternal, withstands any climb * Your quiet fades fast, drowned by my rhyme * \
Magic precise? Precision's my game * Checkmate, Luigi\'97Teflon owns the fame *\

Luigi Verse 2\
I'll craft a final response for Luigi "Il Mago" that delivers a knockout verse against DJ Teflon Don, maintaining the character's smooth but surgical delivery style while matching the energy of the "Firestarter" instrumental.\
ABBA * ABBA * \
Behind your noise, I see the fear in your eyes * While you boast of gold, your empire's built on lies * \
The louder you shout, the more your truth dies * A magician reveals what carefully hides *\
ABBA * ABBA * \
You mistake volume for substance, flash for class * Your "impacts" are shadows that quickly pass *\
 True power moves silent like blade through glass * I don't need your spotlight to outlast your mass *\
ABBA * ABBA * \
Your armor's not Teflon\'97it's paper-thin disguise * The fame you clutch vanishes before wise * \
Each verse I craft deliberately crystallize * The truth that your kingdom eventually dies *\
ABBA * ABBA * \
Il Mago doesn't perform\'97he orchestrates the game * Your endless boasting only highlights your shame * \
My words plant seeds while yours just inflame * When smoke clears, only substance remains *\
Don verse 3\
AB * BA * \
Fear in my eyes? Luigi, you're dreaming * My empire solid, your tricks just scheming * \
Gold gleaming true, no lies to unwind * Your "reveal" just noise, behind my shine *\
AB * BA * \
Substance and flash? I've mastered both lanes * You're slicing glass, I'm breaking chains * \
Quiet moves vanish, unnoticed and small * My spotlight eternal, your silent downfall *\
AB * BA * \
Armor paper-thin? Nah, it's battle-tested steel * Fame everlasting, reality surreal * \
Your words crystallize? Fragile as ice * My kingdom grows stronger with every precise slice *\
AB * BA * \
Orchestrate the game? I'm running the show * Your seeds take too long, my victory's pro * \
Smoke clears fast, yet my flames burn bright * Teflon Don eternal\'97Luigi, goodnight *\
luigi verse 3\
ABBA * ABBA * \
Dreams reveal truth that reality conceals * Your steel facade cracking as pressure reveals * \
What's underneath when your fortune congeals * A house of cards that time eventually steals *\
ABBA * ABBA * \
Chains you break? Self-made prisons, nothing more * While I move between worlds you cannot explore * \
Your spotlight burns bright but burns what's at your core * The wise magician knows what's worth fighting for *\
ABBA * ABBA *\
 Your tested armor shows dents from your own blows * Each "victory" plants seeds of what later grows * \
The higher you climb, the farther you fall below * Il Mago doesn't predict\'97he already knows *\
ABBA * ABBA * \
Your show's all flash with no substance to find * My magic works slowly, transforming the mind * \
When morning comes and your flames left behind * The Magician remains, eternally undefined *\
