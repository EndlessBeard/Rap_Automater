    "description": "An eccentric glam-queen turned hip-hop diva with a heart of gold and a voice like velvet marshmallows. J-Cool LaFlare serves up old-Hollywood meets high-fashion chaos, rocking faux fur, diamond-studded shades, and heels that say \"don't mess\". Her vibe is effortlessly weird, endearingly confident, and totally unpredictable — the lovable auntie of the rap world who'll drop a bar, then offer you a mimosa."

  "musical_style": {
    "description": "Lounge Rap meets Bubblegum Trap — silky, dreamy beats with a playful bounce. Think Doja Cat meets Missy Elliott with a sprinkle of campy Broadway flair. Her flow is whimsical but sharp, blending flirtation, satire, and the occasional offbeat monologue."
