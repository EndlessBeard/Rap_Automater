    "description": "A battle-hardened lyrical warlord, General Truth is the OG of anti-corporate rhymes. Rocking a faded military jacket, campaign ribbons, and scuffed boots, he spits like he's testifying before Congress — because he did. He's not here for fame or flash — he's the watchdog of the republic, exposing the system with the calm intensity of a man who's seen it all. His mic is a weapon, his bars are declassified."

  "musical_style": {
    "description": "Industrial Boom-Bap meets Revolutionary Spoken Word. Dark, militant drums layered with battlefield ambiance, sirens, and ominous horns. His beats sound like they were forged in a war room. Influences: Immortal Technique, Dead Prez, Public Enemy, and a little Rage Against the Machine."
