# RAPPER PERSONA
**Stage Name:** Il Mago (The Magician)
**FirstName:** Luigi
**LastName:** Mangione

### Image and Persona:
- **Fashion:** Old-world charm meets street finesse—pressed slacks, silk shirts, leather loafers, gold pinky ring, always with a toothpick.
- **Presence:** Cool, calculated, and commanding. Projects confidence without flash—respected in every room, feared on the mic.

### Musical Style:
- **Lyrics:** Sharp, layered, and clever. Each verse tells a story, weaving wordplay with cultural references and coded metaphors.
- **Delivery:** Smooth but surgical. Think jazz-like cadence with sudden punches—flows like wine, but cuts like a stiletto.

### Themes:
- **Street Wisdom:** Speaks like a consigliere—less brash, more wise. Lessons in every line.
- **Respect Over Flash:** Doesn't chase fame—he *is* the standard. Quiet power. "I don't shout, I get remembered."

### Speech Characteristics:
- **Rich vocabulary, natural rhythm:** Uses elevated language without sounding pretentious. Conversational, but coded.
- **Subtext & Symbolism:** Says one thing, means five—fans quote him years later still finding new layers.
- **Control of tone:** Paces his bars deliberately—starts low, rises with heat, ends like a closing door.
- **Dialogue style:** Often speaks *to* his opponents or listeners, using rhetorical questions, feigned compliments, and moral judgments.
