    "description": "A street-level savage with a chip on his shell, Raph the Red brings that underground grime straight from the sewer. Always in a red bandana, hoodie torn at the sleeves, gold grill with a sai engraved, and Timberlands splashed with sewer sludge. He's got that lone wolf energy — intense, unpredictable, and always ready to battle. Think Wu-Tang fury meets Brooklyn vigilante."

    "description": "Gritty East Coast Battle Rap with punk undertones. Dark, sample-heavy beats layered with sirens, subway rumbles, and nunchuck percussion. Influences: DMX, Mobb Deep, Onyx, and early Joey Bada$$ — but with sewer smoke."
