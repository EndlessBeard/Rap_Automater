    "description": "Straight from the box to the block, Lil Za is the drippiest slice in the game. Gooey, greasy, and never cheesy (unless he wants to be), he's the flavor king with infinite topping versatility. Rockin' a crusted gold chain, red-and-white checkered tracksuit, and shades shaped like pepperoni slices, Lil Za slides into every verse hotter than a brick oven on Friday night. He's got that universal appeal — underground enough for hipsters, classic enough for boomers, and always in demand. Whether he's in the cypher, the kitchen, or the club, everybody wants a piece."

    "description": "Party Trap meets Funky Boom-Bap with mouth-watering hooks. Beats are saucy, bass-heavy, with cheesy synth layers and crispy hi-hats. Think Flo Rida meets early Snoop Dogg with a sprinkle of Action Bronson's food bars."
