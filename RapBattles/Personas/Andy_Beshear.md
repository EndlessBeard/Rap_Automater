## Image and Persona:
A smooth, level-headed statesman of the soundwaves, Bluegrass B is the people's rapper — all heart, no hype. Dressed in rolled-up sleeves, muddy boots, and a navy windbreaker, he looks like he just came from fixing a flood and still made time to drop a mixtape. He's the hometown hero who spits hope over heartbreak, healing over hate — but don't get it twisted, he can clap back with class.

Soulful Southern Rap with touches of conscious hip-hop and acoustic samples. Beats feature slide guitars, gospel choirs, and 90s R&B hooks. Think J. Cole meets Nappy Roots with John Prine storytelling vibes.
