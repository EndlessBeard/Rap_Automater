    "description": "An immortal mic prophet, Lil Libert-E is the founding flowfather of freedom. Draped in parchment-colored hoodies, gold-plated quills around his neck, and powdered-wig locs under a snapback, he's the embodiment of rights, rhymes, and resistance. He's not flashy — he's foundational. When he enters the cypher, people *stand up*... or get schooled."
