* Begins with a filtered drum pattern introduced via a low-pass filter, gradually building tension. 
* A drone bass plays subtly in the background, providing a foundation for the track.
* The main guitar riff, sampled from The Breeders' "S.O.S.," is introduced, processed through a wah-wah pedal and centered with a slight delay. 

## 2. Build-Up (0:28 – 0:56) - Rapper B, Verse 1
* The rhythm section intensifies with the introduction of a prominent kick drum on every beat, characterized by pronounced mid and high frequencies.
* Phased noise elements, resembling reversed crashes, are added to enhance the build-up.
* A big beat rhythm, comprising snare hits and 16th-note hi-hats, drives the energy forward.

## 3. Main Groove (0:56 – 1:24), Rapper A, Verse 2
